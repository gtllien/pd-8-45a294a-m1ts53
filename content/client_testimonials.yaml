I love that he sits on the floor with my pup and lets him lick him and nibble on his boots. Dr. Berger does not rush through exams, he takes time to make sure all question are answered. He gave us SO much information about our puppy's breed- way more than our previous vet. I will not take my dogs anywhere else.\n"

We have several different breeds of horses and dogs coming to our rescue with various health issues. We love Dr. Berger and his wonderful friendly staff! They stay up to date on the latest treatments and have a deep love for the animals they care for, as well as patience with us worried owners! We have been taking “all” of our animals to the Animal Health Center for several years now. We love the way our horses and dogs are treated, as well as the knowledge the staff share with us at each of our visits. In our opinion, Animal Health Center has THE BEST Veterinarians and staff in the area. Believe me when I tell you that we have gone through some Veterinarians to find the best for our Sanctuary!<br /><br /> "

If you are looking for that special vet, one that will hug your pet as much as you do, then you must give AHC a try. You won’t be disappointed."

We currently have two pups and they treat them as if they are their own! I always feel so fortunate that my “children” have an excellent care!"

      client_testimonial: "I first came into contact with Dr. Berger and his staff at the Animal Health Center of Rolla in June of this year, when they saved my best friend’s life. I first met Molly in October of 2013, when she showed up at my doorstep. My family and I quickly fell in love with that goofy, mischievous puppy, who had never met a stranger in her life. So in June of this year, I knew that there was something wrong with Molly the second she wouldn’t get up to greet people at the door, and it broke my heart.  Her health declined over the next couple of days, and by the time that I got her to Dr. Berger, it was questionable whether our girl would make it or not. Dr. Berger never gave me false hope, but he never gave up on Molly either, and with the help of his staff and their endless care, Molly is here with us today. I can never thank Dr. Berger and everyone at the Animal Health Center of Rolla enough. Not only is Molly nothing short of a miracle, but she is once again her mischievous self, and I so grateful for that. I would recommend anyone to the Animal Health Center of Rolla, after all, they fixed my broken heart."

Dr. Berger has saved my golden retrievers life with an emergency surgery that I will always be grateful for. But beyond that, I am grateful for the fact Harley loves going there which due to his many health issues, ii is often. Anyone who knows me knows my dogs are very important to me, and for something serious I wouldn’t take them anywhere else."

It is rare for Dr. Berger or Dr. Smith not to be able to treat an animal, but if they can’t they will make sure that you get to a specialist that can do the job."
