Our senior care recommendations include semi-annual exams, 27 blood chemistry, complete blood count, thyroid testing and urinalysis with sediment for most pets. With senior bloodwork, we can catch medical conditions earlier and treat earlier for a better outcome. As your pet ages, his or her needs and behavior change. We can help you understand these changes and help you care for your aging pet."
